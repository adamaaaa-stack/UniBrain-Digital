## SEO Notes

- Global metadata (title, description, Open Graph, Twitter, keywords) lives in `app/layout.tsx`. Update that file if copy, site name, or domain changes.
- When adding new sections or pages, include descriptive headings that mention our focus on small business website design in Johannesburg/South Africa.
- Add new routes to `app/sitemap.ts` so search engines can discover them, and ensure `app/robots.ts` continues to allow crawling.
- Always include meaningful `alt` text for images or screenshots so Google and screen readers understand what they show.
- Mention our Johannesburg, Sandton, Fourways, Randburg, Midrand coverage when relevant so local SEO stays strong.
